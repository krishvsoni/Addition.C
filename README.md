#  Workshop Repository

Welcome to the Github workshop repository! This repository contains the materials and code for the workshop on Git and GitHub, specifically focusing on the `fil.c` program.

## About the Workshop


The Git and GitHub workshop is designed to help you understand the basics of version control using Git and how to collaborate effectively on projects using GitHub. In this workshop, we will explore the fundamentals of Git, learn how to set up a repository, create branches, make commits, and manage conflicts. Additionally, we will cover the basics of GitHub, including creating pull requests, reviewing code, and merging changes.

## Repository Contents

1. `file.c`: This is a simple C program that demonstrates the addition of two numbers. It serves as a practice exercise to understand the workflow of making changes, committing them, and pushing to a remote repository.

2. `README.md`: This file provides essential information about the repository, workshop, and instructions for getting started.
